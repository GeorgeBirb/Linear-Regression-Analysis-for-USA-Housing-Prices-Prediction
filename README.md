USA Housing Prices Prediction with Linear Regression
Overview

This GitHub repository provides a detailed analysis of USA housing prices using linear regression. The project is implemented in Python and relies on popular data science libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn. The code encompasses data exploration, visualization, model training, and evaluation.
Contents

    Notebook: The core analysis is presented in a Jupyter notebook (Linear_Regression_USA_Housing.ipynb).

    Dataset: The dataset (USA_Housing.csv) contains information about various factors influencing housing prices in the USA.

Key Steps

    Data Exploration: Load the dataset and explore its structure.

    Visualization: Generate informative visualizations, including pair plots, distribution plots, and heatmaps.

    Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values and select relevant features for the linear regression model.

    Model Building: Utilize Scikit-learn to build a linear regression model.

    Prediction and Evaluation: Make predictions on the test set and evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as mean absolute error and mean squared error.

    Visualization of Results: Create scatter plots to illustrate the relationship between actual and predicted housing prices.
